Description: authenticate Apache against external authentication services
 Mod_Authnz_External can be used to quickly construct secure, reliable
 authentication systems.  It can also be mis-used to quickly open gaping
 holes in your security.  Read the documentation, and use with extreme
 caution.

 (without exposing /etc/shadow file), using, for example, pwauth
 authenticator.

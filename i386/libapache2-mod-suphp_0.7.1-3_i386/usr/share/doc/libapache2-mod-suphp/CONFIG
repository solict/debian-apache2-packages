== suPHP Apache module   ==
===========================

Configuration
-------------

mod_suphp knows the following configuration directives:

suPHP_Engine (can either be turned "on" or "off")

This option tells mod_suphp if a PHP-script requested on this server (or
VirtualHost) should be run with the PHP-interpreter or returned to the
browser "as it is".

This directive can be used in the global context or in a
"<VirtualHost>"-directive.


suPHP_ConfigPath (expects a path name)

This option tells mod_suphp which path to pass on to the PHP-interpreter
(by setting the PHPRC environment variable).
Do *NOT* refer to a file but to the directory the file resists in.

E.g.: If you want to use "/path/to/server/config/php.ini", use "suPHP_Config
/path/to/server/config".

If you don't use this option, PHP will use its compiled in default path.


suPHP_UserGroup (expects user- and groupname)

* Only supported when compiled with setid-mode "force" or "paranoid" *
Specify the user- and groupname to run PHP-scripts with. This setting
can only be used within a <Directory> or <Location> context.
Example: suPHP_UserGroup foouser bargroup


suPHP_AddHandler <mime-type>

Tells mod_suphp to handle requests with the type <mime-type>.
Please note this only works, if an action for the handler is specified
in the suPHP configuration file. Settings on per-directory level supersede
settings made on per-server level.


suPHP_RemoveHandler <mime-type>

Tells mod_suphp NOT to handle requests with the type <mime-type>. This will
override the suPHP_AddHandler setting made on a higher configuration level.


suPHP_PHPPath (expects a path name)

Sets the path to the PHP binary that is used to render files with the
"x-httpd-php" or "application/x-httpd-php" type. This setting does
*NOT* affect the PHP binary used for serving script requests, which is
still configured in suphp.conf.
